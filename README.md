# Freestyle JavaScript Game

## Story

By now you know the basics of Javascript. Put your knowledge to the test,
and create something awesome, creative, and motivating.
Your task is to create a game in the browser. What kind of game?

Wait for it...

Any kind :) Your creativity (and your JavaScript knowledge) is the only limit.

## What are you going to learn?

- Finding DOM elements in the document tree.
- Manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
- Handle user interactions with JavaScript event handlers.
- Use HTML data attributes.
- Use CSS styling.

## Tasks

1. Figure out as a team what game you want to work on and what features you want to finish.
    - A game is chosen that the whole team agrees to implement.
    - The game idea is checked by a mentor to make sure it can be realistically implemented in a sprint
    - The game may be based on one of the following ideas: memory card game, Snake, Towers of Hanoi, simple platformer, Flappy Bird, Space Invaders, classic board games, turn based games, etc.
    - There is a backlog of possible features.
    - A plan is created, based on story estimations of what can be finished by the end of the sprint.

2. Create a playable game based on JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
    - The game is based on handling some kind of event(s) (mouse, keyboard...).
    - The game mainly relies on DOM manipulation to move elements around on the screen or change their appearance (beside CSS of course).
    - The code is separated into several JavaScript functions.

3. [OPTIONAL] The game or parts of it can be time-driven. This adds some complexity, as you have to change things around in given time intervals.
    - Some part of the game changes over time without any interaction (such as a moving enemy or avatar).

4. [OPTIONAL] Implement a way to check the highest scores.
    - The highscore data is stored between games in a database. Scores can be linked to registered users. If the user is not registered, the score can be linked to a name.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Have fun, create a game that is motivating for you! :)
- Figure out what game and the features to implement, based on the following hints.
    - Have a brainstorming session, throw in game and feature ideas without criticizing each other (any idea is a good idea), and write them down somewhere.
    - Discuss the collected ideas and decide on a game.
    - **Talk to a mentor about the idea and whether it can be realistically implemented in a sprint.**
    - Collect any feature ideas you have and specify them so that every team member knows what the expectations are. (These are the [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) in your backlog.)
    - Estimate each user story and figure out how many you can finish in this sprint.
- You can open the `index.html` by starting a small HTTP server. For more information, see the Background materials section.
- Decide whether to create backend functionality. You can use any previously learned technology, such as Flask.
- Use git branches as you develop new features.
- If you search the internet for javascript games, you'll see lots of solutions using [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). It is a nice technology, but we have not met canvas and the main focus of this project is to practice DOM and event handling, so please **say no to canvas for this project**. Later on feel free to learn about canvas with a pet project game for example.
